##emission.py
This module contains the class *emission* which maintains the emission probabilty of text given in a file.
#### Algorithm Specification
This class computes emission probability of the given text with the Maximal Likelihood Estimator (MLE) introduced in Hidden Markov Model.

The general case formula is:
$$ e(word|tag) = \frac{count(word,tag)}{count(tag)+1}$$

As we can hardly learn all possible *"word"*s in the given text file, for a word that has never appeared in the corpus, we provide a special case formula to estimate it's emission probability:
$$e(new|tag) = \frac{1}{count(tag)+1}$$

Internally, this class maintains two Python dictionaries, named *matrix* and *labels*, which has:

	matrix[word][tags] = count(word, tag)
	labels[tag] = count(tag)
####import the module and initialization
	# import the module
	import emission
	# initialization
	e = emission.emission()
This step provides an "empty" emission object whose two internal dictionaries mentioned above are empty.
####compute the parameters with a given corpus
	e.compute("training file name")
After this step the *matrix* and *labels* in emission classes is computed with the training file provided.
####compute emission probability
	e.emit(word, tag, p=True)
	# attention: tag must appear in the given training corpus
	# or it would raise a runtime error
***word*** is the word to be emitted from ***tag***. Parameter *p* stands for "process", when *p* is set True, the object would process *word* (with the tools in toolbox) before computing the emission probability.

This function returns a floating number specifying the emission probability of the given ***word*** and ***tag***.
####guess the most probable tag
	e.mostprob()
It happens in Hidden Markov Model that at some points in a sentence, all possible tags score 0. One enhacement is to tag this position as the most probable label among all possible labels, which could improve the result to some degree.

####MLE predictor:
With the emission probability, one way to predict labels of a given corpus is to use Maximal Likelihood, that is, to find out the most probable tag for the word under emission probability.

	e.predict("input filename","output filename", p=True)
Then the object labels the input file with emission probability MLE and writes the labeled corpus into output file. 

When *p* is set True, the word would be processed with toolbox before computing emission probability.

##transition.py
This module provides a class similar to emission.py, which also maintains four internal dictionaries ***start***, ***stop***, ***matrix*** and ***states*** to compute the transition probability with the MLE in Hidden Markov Model, where:
$$T(y_{i-1}->y_i) = \frac{count(y_{i-1},y{i})}{count(y_{i-1})}$$
In particular, i=1 or i=n respectively denotes that this word is the first or last word of the sentence, under such case the transition probability is:
$$T(y_0->y_1)= \frac{count(START,y_1)}{count(START)}$$
$$T(y_n->y_{n+1}) = \frac{count(y_n,STOP)}{count(STOP)}$$

	matrix[front][current] = count(front, current)
	states[tag] = count(tag)
	start[tag] = count(START,tag)
	stop[tag] = count(tag,STOP)

###import and initialization
	
	import transition
	t = transition.transition()
Similarly to that in emission.py, this procedure give an empty transition object with empty dictioinaries.

###compute the transition probability

	t.compute(training file name)
Also similarly to that in emission.py, this procedure computes the values in the four dictionaries mentioned above

###transit

	t.transit(front, current)
This procedure returns a single floating number denoting the transition probability of transitioning from ***front*** to ***current***, which respective denoting the front tag and current tag.

###startwith
	
	t.startwith(tag)
This method returns a single floating number, that is the value of $T(START,tag)$, denoting the probability of the sentence starts with ***tag***.

###stopwith
	t.stopwith(tag)
Similarly to ***startwith()***, it returns the probability that one sentence stops with ***tag***.

##viterbi.py
This part is the core of our viterbi algorithm, it has two classes and two methods.

####use viterbi to find top1 tag sequence

	viterbi_best(e, t, inputfile, outputfile, p=True)
	e: computed emission object
	t: computed transition object
	inputfile: the path of input file
	outputfile: path of output file
	p: whether do preprocessing before computing probabilities
This function runs the dynamic programming to find the best tag sequence for given observation of word sequence. As the algorithm to compute top N tag sequence is more general, the procedure would be specified in next part.

#### use viterbi to find top N sequence

	viterbi_Nbest(e,t,input,output,best=10,p=True)
	e: computed emission object
	t: computed transition object
	input: path of input file
	output: path of output file
	best: number of best paths to find
	p: whether do preprocessing
This function is implemented with 2 classes:

* worditem,having following attributes:

		word: the previous tag of current position
		score: score of this previous tag at this position
		path: which path of the previous tag this score is from

* NBest:
  This class maintains a heap of worditem to rank previous tags with their respective scores. having following methods:
  		
  		NBest.NBest(best):
  		best value specifying the number of best paths we want
  
		NBest.add(word, prob, path)
		adding a new worditem object with this 3 values
		into the heap
		
		NBest.best()
		remove all paths after ranking behind the specified best
		value


#### algorithm specification

In viterbi algorithm, we have following dynamic transition function:

$Pi [ i , tag ] = Max(Pi [ i-1 , tag’ ] * Transition[ tag’ , tag] * Emission[ tag , word] )$

Base Case:

$Pi [ 0 , START ] = 1$

$Pi [ 0 , tag ] = 0 $ ( for tag is not START )

In order to get the top N sequences, we must save N-best POS tag sequences at every tag choice for every word.

We save the result in the queue in the following format.

$F[ i , tag ] = [ ( Pi1  , previous_tag1 ) …  ( Pi10  , previous_tag10 ) ] $
(If the number of possible choices are above 10. If not, just save all the possible choices in the heap)

The generating procedure is:

* enumerate all positions in a sequence  $O(N)$
* enumerate all possible tags for the word at this position $O(T)$
* enumerate all possible tags for previous position $O(T)$
* enumerate all n scores at the given previous tag and compute the score of current position with the dynamic transition function mentioned above, and push the object having related information into the heap$O(n)$
* for one certain current tag, if all previous tags are already enumerated, remove all previous tag paths ranking behind n.

The decoding procedure is:

* As we know the N best tags at a position and from which previous path of the previous tag it comes from, we can decode the sentence from the last to the beginning. $O(N)$

So all in all, the time complexity of the best N algorithm is $O(nNT^2)$ 

##toolbox.py
This module provides the tools that facilitates other modules, including preprocessor and evaluation methods:
####Preprocessor
	toolbox.preprocess("input file", "output file")
This method preprocesses the input file and write the results into output file. It achieves this by using following two methods:

	#sentence processing
	pword, ptag = toolbox.processSentence(sentence)
This method processes one sentence into one processed word and one processed tag. Temporarily, no modifications are done to tag except extracting it from the sentence.
	
	#word processing
	pword = toolbox.processWord(word)
This method processes a word with the following rule:

  *  when one word contains only punctuations, for example ":)", ":(", remains the same
  *  the words begins with '@' are turned into USR to be currectly labeled as USR
  *  digits are turned into 'digit'
  *  words starting with '#' are turned into 'HT'
  *  for other words with not only punctuations like "hello!", remove the punctuations in them and modify into lower case. This generalization procedure could slightly improve the results.
  *  [deprecated]exception is URL, initially URL are retained, but in terms of the error rate there were not improvements, so deprecated:

		hasURL(word) #judge whether one sentence has URL
